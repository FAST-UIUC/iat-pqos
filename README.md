This is an enhancement of the [Intel RDT Software Package](https://github.com/intel/intel-cmt-cat). 
It includes functionalities of monitoring and tuning DDIO behavior for better I/O performance. 

The corresponding paper, "Don't Forget the I/O When Allocating Your LLC" has appeared in [ISCA'21](https://www.iscaconf.org/isca2021/).

We will release the code as soon as we finish the open-source process required by Intel.
Meanwhile, please feel free to contact [Yifan Yuan](mailto:yifany3@illinois.edu) for early access possibility if you are interested.
